# Node.js Express API with Decorators

Welcome to the **Node.js Express API with Decorators** project! This repository demonstrates how to use decorators to simplify the creation of APIs in Express.

Check out the live demo on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/MiguelFoliaco/decorators_express/main).

## Features

- **Easy API creation**: Simplify your API routes using decorators.
- **Express integration**: Leverage the power of Express.js with a clean and modular approach.
- **TypeScript support**: Take advantage of TypeScript decorators for a better development experience.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get your local development environment set up.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MiguelFoliaco/decorators_express.git
   cd decorators_express
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the HTTP server by running:
```sh
npm start
```

The server will run at `http://localhost:8080`.

I looked at how routes are declared in "src\www\index.ts"
